## Backstory
# Corporates: Corporate Espionage

In the gleaming skyscrapers of Nexus Innovations, a power struggle unfolds behind closed doors. 

Founded by visionary entrepreneurs who built the company from the ground up, Nexus has grown into a tech giant on the verge of a breakthrough that could revolutionize the industry. But success breeds jealousy, and competing corporations have planted mercenaries within Nexus's ranks.

These mercenaries, disguised as loyal employees, have infiltrated key departments. They've been promised substantial payouts from rival companies if Nexus fails. While they appear dedicated in public, they secretly work to undermine the company's progress.

The fate of Nexus now hangs in the balance. The company must complete five critical strategic initiatives to secure its future. Each initiative requires a carefully selected team to execute complex tasks under tight deadlines.

The Founders must identify who they can trust to carry out these missions successfully. Meanwhile, the Mercenaries must sabotage these initiatives while maintaining their cover.

Every team selection is crucial. Every mission is vital. The company's existence depends on the outcome of these five strategic initiatives.

Will the Founders preserve their vision and lead Nexus to unprecedented success? Or will the Mercenaries successfully destroy it from within?

The boardroom has become a battlefield. Trust no one.
