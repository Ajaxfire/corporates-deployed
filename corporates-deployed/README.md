Playable version of the "Corporates" game. 

## Gameplay
First select the number of players and enter their names. Min 5 players. Max 10. 
Each player's role is shown on the screen separately. Pass the device around so that everyone can see their roles. 
Founders can see only their own role. A Mercenary will see their own role and the names of the other mercenaries.
DO NOT REVEAL YOUR ROLES TO ANYONE ELSE DURING THE GAME.

## Initiatives
There are 5 initiatives, and each round one player is assigned as the Leader. 
The leader will select a team that will work on that initiative. The team can only be finalized on agreement with everyone.

## During the Initiative
For the Founders, they can only select Success as an option. 
However, Mercenaries can choose to sabotage the initiative and make it fail. 1 sabotage is enough to fail an initiative. 

## Win conditions
Founders win if three initiatives are successful. Mercenaries win if 3 initiatives fail.
